**Abstract :**
Image prediction is an important area of research in machine learning and computer vision and it is an emerging research field that has gained popularity in recent years. The purpose of this paper is to explore the various techniques and approaches that have been used for image prediction using machine learning.

**Introduction** :
The procedure of predicting an image's properties or labels based on its qualities is known as image prediction. Face identification, scene comprehension, and object recognition are just a few of the uses for image prediction.

**Literature Review :**
Due to their capacity to extract hierarchical representations from unprocessed picture input, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the most advanced method for classifying images. Many experiments have been carried out recently to enhance the effectiveness of CNNs for image classification jobs.The AlexNet architecture suggested by Krizhevsky et al. in 2012 was one of the earliest and most significant works in this subject. Rectified linear units (ReLU) were used as activation functions in this architecture, along with overlapping pooling layers and data augmentation methods including random cropping and horizontal flipping. The ImageNet dataset, which consists of thousands of photos across 1,000 different classifications, was processed using the AlexNet architecture at state-of-the-art speed.
