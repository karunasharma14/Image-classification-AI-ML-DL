**Introduction** :
The procedure of predicting an image's properties or labels based on its qualities is known as image prediction. Face identification, scene comprehension, and object recognition are just a few of the uses for image prediction.

**Literature Review :**
Due to their capacity to extract hierarchical representations from unprocessed picture input, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the most advanced method for classifying images. Many experiments have been carried out recently to enhance the effectiveness of CNNs for image classification jobs.
