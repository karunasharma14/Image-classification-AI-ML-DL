**Abstract :**
Image prediction is an important area of research in machine learning and computer vision and it is an emerging research field that has gained popularity in recent years. The purpose of this paper is to explore the various techniques and approaches that have been used for image prediction using machine learning.

**Introduction** :
The procedure of predicting an image's properties or labels based on its qualities is known as image prediction. Face identification, scene comprehension, and object recognition are just a few of the uses for image prediction.

**Literature Review :**
Due to their capacity to extract hierarchical representations from unprocessed picture input, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the most advanced method for classifying images. Many experiments have been carried out recently to enhance the effectiveness of CNNs for image classification jobs.The AlexNet architecture suggested by Krizhevsky et al. in 2012 was one of the earliest and most significant works in this subject. Rectified linear units (ReLU) were used as activation functions in this architecture, along with overlapping pooling layers and data augmentation methods including random cropping and horizontal flipping. The ImageNet dataset, which consists of thousands of photos across 1,000 different classifications, was processed using the AlexNet architecture at state-of-the-art speed.

**Methodology :**

Introduction: The goal of this machine learning project is to create a model that can correctly identify photos of the dataset into several groups. The objective is to enable automatic image classification.The model can be used to recognize and classify objects in real-world images, which can be useful in applications such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and surveillance systems

Data Collection and Preparation: The data used in this project was sourced from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 color images of 10 different classes of objects, each with 6,000 images. A plane, car, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, or truck is one of the classifications assigned to each image, which has a dimension of 32x32 pixels. In research on machine learning, the dataset is frequently used as a standard for image classification tasks.
The dataset has been used in several machine learning research projects and competitions, and it has been used to train a large number of cutting-edge picture categorization models. It  has also been applied in academic contexts to instruct students in the fields of machine learning and computer vision.
